This folder is for debugging. I try keep my code minimalistic
becase functionality dont depends on things I run (wpasec, p3wifi page).

Sources can be unstables and I dont want change everything for every API changes.
I dont want create complicated unit tests or mocks.
So I created scripts what can help you run it or give you more info about where is problem.


Can be runned from source directory with `python3 what_is_wrong/<broken_tool>_wiw.py`

In page errror messages is not space for long error messages,
here  is.
